* MetaBiLSTM

Pytorch implementation of Meta BiLSTM sequence tagger from this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08237v1.pdf alongwith additions of GRU cells
comparing both their performance. 

* Requirements

1. conllu

* Usage Instructions

The dataset download links and insructions are in =scripts= directory. The rar file needs to be extracted into the =data/embeddings= directory and the CoNLLU dataset needs to be placed in the root of the =dir= directory.

* TODO Add gru config in JSON file
* TODO Fix the metaBiLSTM layer, it's loss is horrible compared to character and word based models
